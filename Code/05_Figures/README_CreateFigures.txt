To create figures, run the R code
1) 00_General.R to load basic objects and functions
2) 01_CreateFigures.R to create individual figures for main text or supplementary data


List of created figures:

Main text figures
- Figure1 - Palindromic defect and sequence logos of PDef-low and PDef-high PPMs 
- Figure2 - whole mixture M08
- Figure3 - nucleotide combinations - legend of created figure is modified and is not identical to the legend in the paper
- Figure4 - HIV-1 intra-Alu hotspot

Supplementary figures
- FigureS1 (Figure1) - PDef
- FigureS2 (Figure2) - whole mixtures M02-M08 - separate figures for each "M"s are created, stored in separated folder and later joined to single pdf
- FigureS3 (Figure3A) - nucleotide combinations - KLID
- FigureS4 (Figure3B) - nucleotide combinations - Frequencies
- FigureS5 (Figure3D) - nucleotide combinations - Most-Least Freq
- FigureS6 (Figure4H) - Alu_Motif_Dist_All
- FigureS7 (Figure4I) - Alu_Motif_Freq_All
